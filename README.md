# IsItPrime
* Simple iPhone App to see if a Number is Prime
* Currently I'm working on Auto Layout in XCode, trying to get this app to work accross various iOS devices. Having a bit of trouble with it,
but that's what this app is for really, practice. Will come back to it soon. 
* The function to determine if the number is prime or not is sound however. Feel free to give it a look.
